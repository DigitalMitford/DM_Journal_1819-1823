    <!--Tasks: Write XSLT template rules to do the following:
        
        
     1. Change the <poemTitle> elements to <title>.
     
     2. We don't need the <body> elements, so let's remove them but preserve their contents
     
     The next two questions ask you to write Attribute Value templates to pull in or calculate a value from the source XML.
    READ ABOUT/LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF ATTRIBUTE VALUE TEMPLATES HERE:
     http://dh.obdurodon.org/avt.xhtml
     
    3. Change the <line> elements into self-closing <lb/> elements to sit at the beginning of each line,
    but keep the @n attribute on them to preserve the line number information.
    
    4. Each poem should have a distinct identifier, usually called an @xml:id attribute.
    Write an attribute value template to add an xml:id attribute to each poem that includes "p-" followed by its number in the sequence of poem elements. 
    (You can calculate this with XPath by counting the preceding poem elements in the document and adding 1.)
