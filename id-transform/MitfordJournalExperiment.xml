   <!--ebb:Note to Digital Mitford Editors: In this typescript, we've noticed the frequent use of the characters XX or X, and my working hypothesis is that these characters indicate points in Mitford's diary that were illegible to the transcriber. However, they also seem to be used in conjunction with titles of books Mitford mentions reading. There is probably some system to this that isn't apparent in the typescript itself. To verify this, we need to consult the original manuscript notebook.-->
   <!-- LMW: The x's are Mitford's. They are in the ms. several possibilities. later additions, to point out books or other refs she wants to remember or re copy elsewhere? x's in letters sometimes refer to added material at bottom of page, like a footnote, but that doesn't seem to be the function here. Add note about this to the msDesc section?-->

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements choice, sic, and reg to encode both Mitford’s
               spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following
               the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured
               forms are not encoded.</p>
