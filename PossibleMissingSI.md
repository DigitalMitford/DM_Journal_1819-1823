- [ ] Rigby_Mr: ebb: we have a generic entry for "Rigby_family" that we can use if we don't know their names. I think probably it's not necessary to create new entries unless we're seeing LOTS of references to them as individuals?

- [ ] Valpy_Anne: ebb: Can we tell if this is a daughter of Richard Valpy? We've identified three: Frances, Penelope, or Catherine based on marriage records because we know that all of Richard Valpy's daughters married, but there may have been
others that we didn't trace yet. We actually created an umbrella entry for "Valpy_Miss" when we're not sure of her name. But what's the context for "Anne Valpy" in the journal? 
- [ ] Valpy_das
- [ ] Valpy_Ed
- [ ] Valpy_Mrs
- [ ] Waristoun
- [ ] Warrener_pet 
- [ ] Wasp_pet
- [ ] Waverley_Novels : ebb: I don't think we need an entry for this unless *MRM herself* refers to the entire set of novels. The phrase just indicates the novels that Walter Scott first published without his name as "by the author of *Waverley*" (which was his first novel). Everyone knew he was writing them apparently. We're mostly interested in the specific novels that she read, and we just mention somewhere in the novel entry that it was one of the Waverley novels. **Do we see MRM commenting on the entire series**?
- [ ] Webb_farmer: ebb: We have all the names of the Webb family spelled out now. MRM's friends are the Webb sisters: Webb_Eliza, Webb_Mary_younger, and their aunt, Webb_Mary_elder. The father is a brewer who lives in Wokingham--probably not a farmer. We have an entry for a Webb_John who we say is "Likely `<q>Uncle John,</q>` uncle
                     to Eliza and Mary Webb and younger brother to James Webb". So does this Webb seem like he's a relative, maybe Uncle John? 
- [x] Webb_Mary: ebb: We changed this to Webb_Mary_elder (for an auntie) and Webb_Mary_younger for the Webb sister that MRM typically writes to. Can we tell which one is being referenced?
