# Possible Missing SI Mentioned throughout Journal

## persName

- [ ] Bocket_Mr
- [ ] Butcher
- [ ] Champion_Mr 
- [ ] Clarkson_Wm
- [ ] Cowper_Mr
- [ ] Deverell_J 
- [ ] Deverell_Miss 
- [ ] Gleig_GRA ebb: **Not sure we want this one? I could not find it in the Journal so I removed it from the back list**. Gleig was mostly not writing until the late 1820s. I found no specific reference to titles by him in the Journal, but am I missing something? 
- [ ] Graham_DofMontrose
- [ ] Harley_Mr
- [ ] HeudeWm 
- [ ] Howell_W 
- [ ] Jephson_Miss ebb: We should check this, but we are *thinking* this may be a reference to Emily Jephson, in the SI already as "Jephson_Em" :: hjb: hjb: Next to two of the attributes for this, it says "cert="low""
- [ ] Jeremy_Miss 
- [ ] LaFontaine 
- [ ] Lane
- [ ] LockeJ  SHOULD BE IN SI :: hjb: I can't find it
- [ ] Maturin_Chas 
- [ ] Molesworth 
- [ ] Morier_J
- [ ] Morse_Miss
- [ ] MuschetN
- [ ] Nicholls
- [ ] Perry_James 
- [ ] Rapley_Ha   ebb: We have several Rapleys in the SI (but no one with "Ha"): This one is "Hannah". Apparently this one is tricky (two different people named "John Rapley": I think we should check the passage in the journal (look at the MS too), and ask Lisa Wilson and Sam Webb for help on this one.  LMW says this is maybe John's wife or sister? Read the other Rapley entries in the SI. LMW maybe can check with Sam Webb about this.
- [ ] Riley_James
- [ ] Rogers_Miss
- [ ] Ross_Miss 
- [ ] Shaw_Sam 
- [ ] Sidney_SirP  look for Sir Philip Sidney in the SI :: hjb: There is no persName, but there is a book titled "Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Sir Philip Sidney" with the tag "#Mems_Sidney_TZ"
- [ ] Smith_James
- [ ] Stephenson_Mr
- [ ] Sweetser_Ch  This is her maid's brother (she will marry Charles Hill. WE NEED A NEW ENTRY. Also check LMW's tree on ancestry
- [ ] Tweddell_Miss
- [ ] Valpy_das ebb: I bet this is a generic reference to the Valpy daughters as a group: in which case we can use "Valpys" or "Valpy_Miss"
- [ ] Waristoun  
- [ ] Warrener_pet  (a dog of the Webb family! LMW MIGHT HAVE AN ENTRY SOMEWHERE?)
- [ ] Wasp_pet   (another dog of the Webb family! LMW MIGHT HAVE AN ENTRY SOMEWHERE?)
- [ ] Waverley_Novels : ebb: I don't think we need an entry for this unless *MRM herself* refers to the entire set of novels. The phrase just indicates the novels that Walter Scott first published without his name as "by the author of Waverley" (which was his first novel). Everyone knew he was writing them apparently. We're mostly interested in the specific novels that she read, and we just mention somewhere in the novel entry that it was one of the Waverley novels. **Do we see MRM commenting on the entire series**?
- [ ] Webb_farmer:  LMW: This is a local farmer who owns land near the Bertram house. From JOURNAL: He gave Fly to MRM! We can update the Fly entry, AND make a new entry for him to make sure he's not connected to the usual Webb family: "As far as we know, not related to..."
ebb: We have all the names of the Webb family spelled out now. MRM's friends are the Webb sisters: Webb_Eliza, Webb_Mary_younger, and their aunt, Webb_Mary_elder. The father is a brewer who lives in Wokingham--probably not a farmer. We have an entry for a Webb_John (LMW: HE DOESN'T LIVE IN THE AREA) who we say is "Likely `<q>Uncle John,</q>` uncle to Eliza and Mary Webb and younger brother to James Webb". So does this Webb seem like he's a relative, maybe Uncle John?
- [ ] Wesley_Chas
- [ ] Wesley_John
- [ ] Wheeler_John  ebb: Check the "Wheeler_James" entry in the SI. Check the MS: Could this be James, or is this definitely someone else? :: hjb: He is mentioned as "Mr. John Wheeler" in the journals.
- [ ] Wheeler_Mr  ebb: see above: should this be "Wheeler_James"? :: hjb: There are "two Mr. Wheelers: according to MRM's journal entry on 1819-05-24. It has a Wheeler_Mr and Wheeler_James tagged on that quote.
- [ ] Whistle_pet 
- [ ] WilsonRbt 
- [ ] Woodburn_Mrs   ebb: Looks like we need to make a new family entry for this group...
- [ ] Woodburn_son   (see above)


## placeName
- [ ] arbour  ebb: probably not a name. It's just a word that means a tree-shaded garden area :: hjb: Should we tag this as Three Mile Cross where she refers to this?
