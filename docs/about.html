            <p class="block">Hey there, I am a Senior at Penn State Behrend in the DIGIT program. I
                have strong passions for the content creation (Photography and Film) side of this
                major, but also enjoy the digital humanities side of it. I also am a big fan of
                competitve esports and even joined the esports scene here at PSU Behrend recently to
                compete with fellow classmates. A portfolio of my Photography can be found on <a

            <p class="block">Hi! I am a sophomore student at PSU Behrend and in my first year in the
                DIGIT major. I used to be Computer Science major my first year of college, but I
                knew that it wasn't for me, I liked technology but also Art, so I knew that DIGIT
                was the major for me. Currently I am in DIGIT classes 100 and 110, working on many
                projects throughout the semester and excited for more. If you want to see my
                portfolio of all my projects, visit my <a

            <p class="block">Hello! I'm a Junior at Penn State Behrend and I'm in the DIGIT Program.
                I like to create a lot of different things and was drawn to the DIGIT Program
                because of that. I like to create short films and other various art projects in my
                spare time and hope to make stuff that people can enjoy! A portfolio of some of my
                work can be seen <a href="https://tylerakam.github.io/takam/">here!</a></p>
