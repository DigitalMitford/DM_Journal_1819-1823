                <div id="r1">
                    <p>This area of our website hosts an edition of Mary Russell Mitford's journal,
                        which she kept from late December 1818 to March 1823. Mitford wrote her
                        short entries nearly every day for a little over four years in a volume
                        designed only to hold one year of entries. That volume was a production of
                        Leigh Hunt’s, <i>The Literary Pocket Book: or, Companion for the Lover of
                            Art and Nature</i>, a kind of almanac meant for keeping daily records
                        and including quotations from Edumnd Spenser as well as contemporary poets
                        including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Shelley, and
                        John Keats. A lengthy portion of the volume included lists of <q>eminent
                            persons in letters, philosophy, and the arts from the most remote
                            aeras,</q> as well as contemporary authors, artists, musicians, medical
                        lecturers, and locations of theaters, art exhibits, sculpture galleries,
                        circulating libraries, and practical information on law, bankers, money, and
                        stamps. It seems to have been an almanac of practical information for those
                        interested in the arts and literature, with a central section devoted to
                        keeping daily diary entries for the year 1819. Mitford received the volume
                        as a Christmas present from her father in 1818, and she wrote rapturously of
                        it to her friend, Sir William Elford in <a
                            href="https://digitalmitford.org//getLetterText.php?uri=1819-01-09-Elford.xml"
                            >a letter of 9 January 1819</a>.</p>
                    <blockquote> I have just had a very pretty little present The Literary Pocket
                        Book. Have you seen one of them ? They are edited I believe by Leigh Hunt
                        certainly the greater part is written by him &amp; exceedingly well written.
                        I have seen nothing of the sort so well executed. First of all there is a
                        Naturalist’s Calendar very beautifully written—indeed those not quite
                        extensive enough for the title It should rather have been called the
                        Florist's Calendar—& even then it would seem a little suburbian—rather
                        Hampstead Heathish—but very pretty nevertheless—Then in the common pocket
                        book part—the months & weeks & days there are occasional notices of birth
                        days of great men—Bacon Shakespeare & so forth, which come upon one very
                        pleasantly—Then lists of Artists Musicians Actors & Authors (only think of
                        their having left me out! That Authorial list is very incomplete indeed! Not
                        one word about me! And my own friends too! Ah they have no <q>idea that I am
                            blueish</q> to borrow my friend the Dandy’s phrase—He would have stuck
                        me at the head of the list) well these catalogues notwithstanding this great
                        omission are very gratifying—&amp; then there is Poetry—not quite so good as
                        I expected from Mr. Hunt, Mr. Keats, &amp;c but still much better than ever
                        adorned a pocket book before—[good] enough to stare & wonder how it came
                        there. If you wa[nt] such a book I would recommend it to you. </blockquote>

                <div id="r2">
                    <p>For all her effusions over the densely printed contents of the pocket book,
                        Mitford would overwrite a large portion of that print matter with regular
                        entries over four years plus a few months in a diary designed for just one
                        year. She drew her own lines separating the entries and marked headings
                        keeping track of months and years. The journal is a daunting challenge to
                        any transcriber, and the Digital Mitford team is grateful to the anonymous
                        transcriber(s) who prepared a typescript of her entries dated 1955 and
                        stored at the British Library. We have prepared our edition of Mitford’s
                        Journal by first entering the text from our photofacsimile of the typescript
                        and then carefully checking against our photofacsimile of the handwritten
                        journal prepared for us by the British Library. The 1955 typescript was not
                        always complete, and sometimes we have been able to fill in missing portions
                        and identify words and proper names. Both the 1955 typescript and our
                        edition attempt to represent only Mitford’s writings in the journal, rather
                        than include the printed material on the page surfaces.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We have organized our web reading interface for the Journal edition to store
                        one month of journal entries on each page. A navigation menu on the left
                        assists in choose year, month, and day. As usual across the Digital Mitford
                        website, we highlight named entities for which we provide information on the
                        right.
                        <!-- ebb: NOTE I'm also hoping to pull data on related letters and any other files in the project to be linked from the right-hand side panel as well. TBD -->.
                        Where we supply editorial notes on some of the entries, these are set apart
                        typographically from Mitford's writing in small formatted blocks.</p>
