                           temperate Europe, Asia and North America. <span class="persName gloss" data-gloss="#MRM"><a href="#MRM">Mitford</a></span> likely refers to the European
                           beech (Fagus sylvatica) which is considered native to the southern UK and introduced
                           elsewhere for tall hedging and plantations, particularly after the eighteenth century.
                           More recently, research suggests the beech was introduced into England around 4,000
                           B.C. and so is non-native. Beech woods are densely canopied with floors suitable only
                           for shade-loving understory plants such as <span class="name">bluebell</span>s. The bark is smooth and light grey and the tree bears inconspicuous flowers and
                           catkins that develop into husk-enclosed nuts that are bitter but edible. The nuts
                           and bark are high in tannins, used to tan leather, and the trees produce a fine-grained
                           medium-weight wood used for indoor flooring, staircases, and small furniture. It also
                           makes good firewood, as well as wood pulp for papermaking.</div>

                              Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                              &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                              Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                              to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                              1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in

                              to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                              until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="placeName gloss" data-gloss="#Reading_School"><a href="#Reading_School">Reading Grammar School</a></span> for boys over

                              buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and
                              Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                              as Shakespeareâ€™s King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His <span class="title">Elements of

                              used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s students

                              triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                              organizations. Valpy enlisted <span class="persName gloss" data-gloss="#MRM"><a href="#MRM">Mitford</a></span> to write reviews of the productions
