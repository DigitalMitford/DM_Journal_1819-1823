                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British
                        folk tales and popular culture, the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday
                        in the mid-nineteenth century. The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin
                        or Robert, which led to nicknames of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally
                        less wary of humans than their counterparts in continental Europe. Mitford calls the
                        tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>One of Mitfordâ€™s favorite flowers, blooms in spring in Berkshire. Mitford likely refers
                        to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, native
                        to western and southern Europe, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+ species
                        of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not closely related
                        to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions the evening primrose
                        in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in Europe since the early seventeenth
                        century and are now naturalized in some parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

                     </ul>
                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                     <p>According to Lâ€™Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of Mitfordâ€™s father, and Mitford
                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                     <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of Charles Fyshe Palmer and Lucy Jones. He married
                        Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire
                        . They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead,
                        Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most
                        influential aristocratic families in the country, and Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage
                        to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                        House. A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the member
                        for Reading after 1816, and appears to have served off and on in that role until 1841.
                        He led the Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo
                        Massacre in 1819. On March 16, 1820, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against two
                        other candidates. The votes ran: John Berkeley Monck (418 votes), Charles Fyshe Palmer(399
                        votes), and John Weyland(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s letters around this time indicate she
                        much preferred his opponent J. B. Monck, and she had earlier satirized Palmer in 1818
                        as vastly like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long fishing-rod,
                        or anything that is all length and no substance. Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection
                        with a legal issue surrounding the Billiard Club, in her letter to Talfourd of 31
                        August 1822 . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents sometimes
                        undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble privileges (and money)
                        he accrued by marrying the Lady Madelina Gordon in 1805.</p>

                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New

                     <p>Richard Valpy (the fourth of that name) was the eldest son of Richard Valpy [III]
                        and Catherine Chevalier. He was a friend and literary mentor to Mary Russell Mitford.
                        He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen,
                        as a Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D. &amp; D.D.
                        (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard Valpy served as Second
                        Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771 to 1781, and was also collated
                        to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in 1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading
                        School, Reading, Berkshire, in 1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned
                        the Headmastership over to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                        until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of Reading Grammar School
                        for boys over the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added
                        new buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and Latin
                        textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such as Shakespeareâ€™s
                        King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His Elements of Greek Grammar, Elements of Latin
                        Grammar,,Greek Delectus and Latin Delectus, printed and published by his son A. J.
                        Valpy, were all much used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s
                        students performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                        triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable organizations. Valpy
                        enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions for the Reading Mercury. In 1803,
                        his adaptation of Shakespeareâ€™s King John was performed at Covent Garden Theatre.
                        Richard Valpy was married twice and had twelve children, eleven of whom lived to adulthood.
                        His first wife was Martha Cornelia de Cartaret; Richard and Martha were married about
                        1778 and they had one daughter, Martha Cartaretta Cornelia. His first wife Martha
                        died about 1780 and he married Mary Benwell of Caversham, Oxfordshire on May 30, 1782.
                        Together they had six sons and five daughters and ten of their eleven children survived
                        to adulthood. Richard Valpy and Mary Benwellâ€™s sons were Richard Valpy (the fifth
                        of that name), Abraham John Valpy, called John; Gabriel Valpy, Anthony Blagrove Valpy;
                        and Francis Edward Jackson Valpy. His daughters were Mary Ann Catherine Valpy; Sarah
                        Frances Valpy, called Frances or Fanny; Catherine Elizabeth Blanch Valpy; Penelope
                        Arabella Valpy; and Elizabeth Charlotte Valpy, who died as an infant. Richard Valpy
                        died on March 28, 1836 in Reading, Berkshire, and is buried in All Souls cemetery,
                        Kensal Green, London. Dr. Valpyâ€™s students placed a marble bust of him in St. Lawrenceâ€™s
                        church, Reading, Berkshire, after his death. John Opie painted Dr. Valpyâ€™s portrait.

                     <p>A lifelong friend of Mary Russell Mitford who knew her from their childhood in the
                        1790s, Harness launched the first major effort to collect and edit Mitfordâ€™s letters
                        into a series of volumes, which was completed by his assistant, Alfred Guy Kingan
                        Lâ€™Estrange a year after Harnessâ€™s death, and published as The Life of Mary Russell
                        Mitford, Related in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends. This collection was
                        originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the publishers,
                        to Harnessâ€™s distress. Harness and Byron were also friends from their schooling at
                        Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harnessâ€™s experience of a disabled foot, crushed
                        in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered dedicating the first two cantos
                        of Childe Haroldâ€™s Pilgrimage to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harnessâ€™s
                        reputation as he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitfordâ€™s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of the few
                        of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over prose. When William
                        Macready was attacked in an anonymous Blackwoodâ€™s Magazine piece in 1825 for his demands
                        and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to Rienzi, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in 1839 after many years of distance, Harness
                        assured Macready in person that he was not the writer, though he may have shared word
                        of the poor treatment his friend had endured. William Harness was the son of John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on April
                        13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from Christâ€™s College,
                        Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816).
                        He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit Street, London and minister and lecturer
                        at St. Anneâ€™s in Soho. He was Boyle lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead
                        from 1828 to 1844. In 1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including
                        a biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge for the
                        study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays and reviews, some
                        for the Quarterly Review. From 1844 to 1847 he was minister of Brompton Chapel in
                        London. He undertook to raise the funds to build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge,
                        in the parish of St. Margaretâ€™s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became
                        perpetual curate of that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at
                        3 Hyde Park Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister Mary Harness
                        and his first cousin Jemima Harness, daughter of his uncle William. He died while
                        on a visit to one of his former curates in Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death
                        he living at the same address at 3 Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.Sources:
