                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture,
                        the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames
                        of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally less wary of humans than their counterparts
                        in continental Europe. Mitford calls the tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                        flowers, blooms in spring in <span class="placeName">Berkshire</span>.
                        Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                        family Primulaceae, native to <span class="placeName">western and southern
                           Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                        species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                        closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                        the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                        Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                        parts of Europe and Asia. </p>

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq..

                        <p>Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                           in <span class="placeName">Plymouth, Devon</span>, from its
                           founding in <span class="date">1782</span>. He was elected a member of

                           in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                           from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                           Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                           son <span class="persName">Jonathan</span> came of age, he tried to
                           secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                           Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                           Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                           the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                           Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. <span class="persName">Sir

                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to

                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against

                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long

                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>

                     <p>Catherine Allingham was the daughter of Thomas Allingham. She married Charles Dickinson
                        on <span class="date">August 2, 1807</span> at St. Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex. They lived in Swallowfield, Berkshire, where
                        their daughter Frances was born, and where they were visited by the Mitford family.
                        According to Mitford, Catherine Dickinson was fond of match-making among her friends
                        and acquaintances. (See

                           Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                           Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                           Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                           1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over
                           to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                           until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="placeName">Reading Grammar School</span> for boys over
                           the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new

                           Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                           as Shakespeareâ€™s King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His Elements of

                           used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s students
                           performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                           triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions

                        <p>A lifelong friend of <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>
                           who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                           major effort to collect and edit Mitfordâ€™s letters into a series of volumes,
                           which was completed by his assistant, <span class="persName">Alfred Guy
                              Kingan Lâ€™Estrange</span> a year after Harnessâ€™s death, and published
                           as <span class="title">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                              in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</span>. This collection
                           was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                           publishers, to Harnessâ€™s distress.</p>
                        
                        <p>Harness and <span class="persName">Byron</span> were also friends from
                           their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harnessâ€™s experience of
                           a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                           dedicating the first two cantos of <span class="title">Childe Haroldâ€™s
                              Pilgrimage</span>
                            to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harnessâ€™s reputation as
                           he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                           Mitfordâ€™s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                           the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                           prose. When <span class="persName">William Macready</span> was
                           attacked in an anonymous Blackwoodâ€™s Magazine piece
                           in 1825 for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                           <span class="title">Rienzi</span>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                           the author of the anonymous piece, though in <span class="date">1839</span>
                           after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                           not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                           friend had endured.</p>
                        
                        <p>William Harness was the son of John
                           Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                           April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                           Christâ€™s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                           (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                           Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anneâ€™s in Soho. He was Boyle
                           lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                           1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                           biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                           for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                           and reviews, some for the <span class="title">Quarterly Review</span>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                           minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                           build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                           Margaretâ€™s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate
                           of
                           that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                           Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <span class="persName">Mary Harness</span>
                           and his first cousin <span class="persName">Jemima Harness</span>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                           while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                           Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                           Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.</p>Sources:
