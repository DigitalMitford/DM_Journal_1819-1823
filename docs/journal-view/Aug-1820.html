                        July. A favorite subject for poets from at least the early-modern period; in Mitford's

                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                        tormented by financial difficulties. He painted <span class="persName">William Wordsworthâ€™s</span> portrait in 1842. <span class="persName">MRM</span> was introduced to him at his London studio in the spring of

                        older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                        distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                        siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,
                        which resulted in <span class="persName">Mary Russell</span> inheriting

He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                              Jones</span>. He married <span class="persName">Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair</span> in <span class="date">1805</span> at <span class="placeName">Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton,
                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,

                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>

                           son <span class="persName">Jonathan</span> came of age, he tried to

                     </ul>
                     <p>Lady Madelina Gordon was born on June 10, 1772,
                        the daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, and Jane Maxwell, at
                        Gordon Castle, Bellie, Moray, Scotland. Her first husband was Robert Sinclair,
                        7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and had one child, John Gordon
                        Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>. They married in 1805 at
                        Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House,
                        Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her
                        siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential
                        aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became
                        Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of
                        Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister
                        <span class="persName">Susan Gordon</span> became Duchess of Manchester through her
                        marriage to <span class="persName">William Montagu, Duke of Manchester</span>. Her
                        sister <span class="persName">Louise Gordon</span> became Marchioness Cornwallis through
                        marriage to <span class="persName">Charles Cornwallis, Marquess of Cornwallis</span>.
                        Her sister <span class="persName">Georgiana Gordon</span> became Duchess of Bedford
                        through marriage to <span class="persName">John Russell, Duke of Bedford</span>. Her
                        brothers were <span class="persName">George Duncan Gordon</span>, who became 5th Duke of
                        Gordon, and <span class="persName">Lord Alexander Gordon</span>. <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>â€™s marriage to Lady Madelina
                        thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland House. Lady Madelinaâ€™s name is
                        variously spelled Madelina and Madalina, although Madelina
                        appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an
                        anglicization of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in
