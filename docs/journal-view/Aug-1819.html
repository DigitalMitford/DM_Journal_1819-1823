He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>.

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
