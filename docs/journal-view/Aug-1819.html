                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>

                        MDCLXVI in 1667 , reflecting on climactic events of the previous year, the Great Fire
                        of London and the second Anglo-Dutch War. Dryden supported a revival of drama in Restoration
                        England, and in 1668 he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie , which contained critiques of William
                        Shakespeare's and Ben Jonson's plays and reflection on English and French theater
                        and playwrights from the Renaissance to the Restoration in England. Several of his
                        plays were staged in London in the 1670s, including his treatment of the Antony and
                        Cleopatra narrative, in All for Love, or, The World Well Lost, performed in December
                        1677 and published in 1678 . His satirical poem Absalom and Achitophel, published
                        in 1681, presents Restoration politicians and government figures in Old Testament
                        roles, casting King Charles II in flattering terms as a merciful and benevolent David.</p>

                     <p>Friend of the Mitford family. He was the son of Vikris Dickinson and Elizabeth Marchant.
                        The Dickinson family were Quakers who lived in the vicinity of Bristol, Gloucestershire.
                        On August 3, 1807, he married Catherine Allingham at St Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex.
                        They lived at Farley Hill, near Swallowfield, Berkshire, where their daughter Frances
                        was born, and where the Mitfords visited them. Charles Dickinson owned a private press
                        he employed to print literary works by his friends (See letters to Elford from March
                        13, 1819 and June 21, 1820). He wrote and published an epic poem in sixty-six cantos,

                     <p>Richard Valpy (the fourth of that name) was the eldest son of Richard Valpy [III]
                        and Catherine Chevalier. He was a friend and literary mentor to Mary Russell Mitford.
                        He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen,
                        as a Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D. &amp; D.D.
                        (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard Valpy served as Second
                        Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771 to 1781, and was also collated
                        to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in 1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading
                        School, Reading, Berkshire, in 1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned
                        the Headmastership over to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                        until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of Reading Grammar School
                        for boys over the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added
                        new buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and Latin
                        textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such as Shakespeareâ€™s
                        King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His Elements of Greek Grammar, Elements of Latin
                        Grammar,,Greek Delectus and Latin Delectus, printed and published by his son A. J.
                        Valpy, were all much used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s
                        students performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                        triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable organizations. Valpy
                        enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions for the Reading Mercury. In 1803,
                        his adaptation of Shakespeareâ€™s King John was performed at Covent Garden Theatre.
                        Richard Valpy was married twice and had twelve children, eleven of whom lived to adulthood.
                        His first wife was Martha Cornelia de Cartaret; Richard and Martha were married about
                        1778 and they had one daughter, Martha Cartaretta Cornelia. His first wife Martha
                        died about 1780 and he married Mary Benwell of Caversham, Oxfordshire on May 30, 1782.
                        Together they had six sons and five daughters and ten of their eleven children survived
                        to adulthood. Richard Valpy and Mary Benwellâ€™s sons were Richard Valpy (the fifth
                        of that name), Abraham John Valpy, called John; Gabriel Valpy, Anthony Blagrove Valpy;
                        and Francis Edward Jackson Valpy. His daughters were Mary Ann Catherine Valpy; Sarah
                        Frances Valpy, called Frances or Fanny; Catherine Elizabeth Blanch Valpy; Penelope
                        Arabella Valpy; and Elizabeth Charlotte Valpy, who died as an infant. Richard Valpy
                        died on March 28, 1836 in Reading, Berkshire, and is buried in All Souls cemetery,
                        Kensal Green, London. Dr. Valpyâ€™s students placed a marble bust of him in St. Lawrenceâ€™s
                        church, Reading, Berkshire, after his death. John Opie painted Dr. Valpyâ€™s portrait.
