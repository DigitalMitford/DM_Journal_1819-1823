                        contemporary, historical, classical, biblical, and mythological scenes, though
                        tormented by financial difficulties. He painted <span class="persName">William Wordsworthâ€™s</span> portrait in 1842. <span class="persName">MRM</span> was introduced to him at his London studio in the spring of
                        1817, and <span class="persName">Sir William Elford</span> was a

                        <p>Father of <span class="persName">Mary Rusell Mitford</span>, <span class="persName">George Mitford</span> was the son of <span class="persName">Francis Midford</span>, surgeon, and <span class="persName">Jane Graham</span>. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that
                           he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>
                        
                        <p>He married <span class="persName">Mary Russell</span> on <span class="date">October 17, 1785</span> at <span class="placeName">New Alresford, Hampshire</span>. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as <span class="placeName">Old Alresford</span>; they later came to live
                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>, was born two years
                           later on <span class="date">December 16, 1787</span> at <span class="placeName">New
                              Alresford, Hampshire</span>. He assisted <span class="persName">Mitford</span>'s literary career by representing her interests in London and elsewhere with theater
                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local
                           magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with his friend <span class="persName">James Webb</span>.</p>

                        older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                        distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                        siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,

                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in

                           to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                           until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="placeName">Reading Grammar School</span> for boys over

                           Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                           as Shakespeareâ€™s King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His Elements of

                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                           for the <span class="title">Reading Mercury</span>. In 1803, his
                           adaptation of Shakespeareâ€™s King John was performed at Covent Garden

                           <span class="persName">Mitford</span> met him for the first time in the

                        <p>Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                           in <span class="placeName">Plymouth, Devon</span>, from its
                           founding in <span class="date">1782</span>. He was elected a member of
                           Parliament for Plymouth as a

                           Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                           son <span class="persName">Jonathan</span> came of age, he tried to
                           secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                           Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                           Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                           the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                           Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. <span class="persName">Sir

                           exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                           to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                           talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                           Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
