                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture,
                        the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames
                        of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally less wary of humans than their counterparts
                        in continental Europe. Mitford calls the tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                        a husk and harvested in the late summer. Hazelnuts are round and the kernel edible
                        and may be eaten fresh or dried. Mitford employs the term cobnut and distinguishes it from the filberd. The shrubby trees form an important component of hedgerows, particularly in the
                        English lowlands. The trees may also be managed by coppicing, a practice that produces
                        the thin, curved poles traditionally used in making withy and wattle fencing, in wattle-and-daub
                        building, and in framing coracle boats.</p><iframe src="https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Corylus_maxima"></iframe><ul>

                        red and yellow-green fruit. Cultivated varieties developed from wild trees in Central
                        Asia, and have likely been domesticated for at least four thousand years. Before the
                        invention of refrigeration, the fruit was important for its ability to be dried, to
                        overwinter in cold storage and to produce fermented cider. While the apple appears
                        in many mythological and religious traditions as a mystical or forbidden object, as
                        in the forbidden Edenic fruit in the Old Testament, the term generally referred to
                        any edible or non-native fruit, and did not necessarily indicate fruits of the genus
                        Malus. There are currently more than 7,000 apple cultivars and the University of Reading,
                        in Berkshire, is responsible for the UK national apple database. Mitford mentions
                        at least three varieties: golden rennet or Golden Reinette also known as the English pippin, a golden-yellow apple, streaked red-orange; russetting types, apples whose smooth skin is covered all or in part by rougher brown skin,
                        thought to have more nutty and aromatic flavors than non-russeting types and used
                        in cider making; and a crumplingtype; an underdeveloped or deformed apple that shrivels on the tree.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/apple/"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>During the 19th century, four types of doves and pigeons were found in Britain: the
                        <span class="name">stock dove</span>, the <span class="name">rock dove</span>, or feral species of the domestic pigeon, and the <span class="name">turtle dove</span>, as well as the <span class="name">wood pigeon</span>. Domesticated pigeons such as carrier, homing, and racing pigeons are species of
                        the rock dove. In Britain, the <span class="name">wood pigeon</span> is hunted as a game bird and domesticated pigeons were also used as food. In the
                        ancient world, doves were associated with goddesses of love, sexuality, and maternity,
                        such as Inanna Ishtar and Aphrodite. Doves carry symbolic significance in both the
                        Old and New Testaments of the Hebrew Bible: in Genesis in the story of Noah and the
                        ark as a symbol of peace and deliverance, in the Song of Songs as a term of endearment,
                        and in Matthew as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Doves were also acceptable burnt offerings
                        and came to symbolize peace in early Christianity. Later literary and artistic references
                        often draw on this association of white doves with peace, deliverance, and spiritual
                        gifts, and are representations of the rock dove, which is highly variable in color,
                        ranging from white to shades of grey and pale brown.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/pigeons-and-doves/"></iframe><ul>

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that
                           he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>, was born two years
                           later on <span class="date">December 16, 1787</span> at <span class="placeName">New

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                           [III] and Catherine Chevalier. He was a friend and literary mentor to
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>. He matriculated at
                           Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                           Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                           Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                           1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over
                           to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                           until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="placeName">Reading Grammar School</span> for boys over
                           the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new
                           buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and
                           Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                           as Shakespeare’s King John and Sheridan’s The Critic. His Elements of
                           Greek Grammar, Elements of Latin Grammar,,Greek
                           Delectus and Latin Delectus, printed and published by
                           his son <span class="persName">A. J. Valpy</span>, were all much
                           used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpy’s students
                           performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                           triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                           for the <span class="title">Reading Mercury</span>. In 1803, his
                           adaptation of Shakespeare’s King John was performed at Covent Garden
                           Theatre.</p>

                           lived to adulthood. His first wife was <span class="persName">Martha
                              Cornelia de Cartaret</span>; Richard and Martha were married about
