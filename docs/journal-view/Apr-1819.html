                        likely refers to wild forms of the Viola, a genus of flowering plants in the violet
                        family Violaceae. It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500
                        species. Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The term pansy
                        is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered cultivars which are used
                        as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are used for small-flowered annuals
                        or perennials, including the species.</p>

                     <p>Mitford likely refers to common wood sorrel, a member of the oxalis family. It grows
                        in mixed woodlands and bears a white flower. It is not related to sorrel proper (Rumex
                        acetosa), although the two plants share an acidic taste that may have led to the name.</p>

                        England and Scotland. After the so-called tulip mania in Europe in the 17th century,
                        tulips became associated with the Netherlands and Dutch Golden Age painters, who included
                        them in their still-life paintings. In her Journal, Mitford refers to field tulips,
                        presumably a naturalized population in Berkshire.</p><iframe src="https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tulipa"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        letters were also addressed to her at Bellevue, Lower Road, Richmond (Coles 26). She
                        was buried at St. Mary Magdalene, Richmond, Surrey. In the 1841 census, she is listed

                     <p>Mary Russell was the youngest child of the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and his second
                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>

                     <p>According to Lâ€™Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of Mitfordâ€™s father, and Mitford
                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                     <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of Charles Fyshe Palmer and Lucy Jones. He married
                        Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire
                        . They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead,
                        Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most
                        influential aristocratic families in the country, and Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage
                        to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                        House. A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the member
                        for Reading after 1816, and appears to have served off and on in that role until 1841.
                        He led the Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo
                        Massacre in 1819. On March 16, 1820, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against two
                        other candidates. The votes ran: John Berkeley Monck (418 votes), Charles Fyshe Palmer(399
                        votes), and John Weyland(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s letters around this time indicate she
                        much preferred his opponent J. B. Monck, and she had earlier satirized Palmer in 1818
                        as vastly like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long fishing-rod,
                        or anything that is all length and no substance. Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection
                        with a legal issue surrounding the Billiard Club, in her letter to Talfourd of 31
                        August 1822 . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents sometimes
                        undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble privileges (and money)
                        he accrued by marrying the Lady Madelina Gordon in 1805.</p>

                     <p>Lady Madelina Gordon was born on June 10, 1772, the daughter of Alexander Gordon,
                        4th Duke of Gordon, and Jane Maxwell, at Gordon Castle, Bellie, Moray, Scotland. Her
                        first husband was Robert Sinclair, 7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and
                        had one child, John Gordon Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician
                        Charles Fyshe Palmer. They married in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire.
                        They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead,
                        Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most
                        influential aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became
                        Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond,
                        4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister Susan Gordon became Duchess
                        of Manchester through her marriage to William Montagu, Duke of Manchester. Her sister
                        Louise Gordon became Marchioness Cornwallis through marriage to Charles Cornwallis,
                        Marquess of Cornwallis. Her sister Georgiana Gordon became Duchess of Bedford through
                        marriage to John Russell, Duke of Bedford. Her brothers were George Duncan Gordon,
                        who became 5th Duke of Gordon, and Lord Alexander Gordon. Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage
                        to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                        House. Lady Madelinaâ€™s name is variously spelled Madelina and Madalina, although Madelina
                        appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an anglicization
                        of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in The Browningâ€™s Correspondence

                        into his subject, but he does not put his whole heart &amp; soul into it [. . . ] What
                        charms me most in Mr. Haslitt is the beautiful candour which he bursts forth sometimes
                        from his own prejudices [ . . . ] I admire him so ardently that when I begin to talk
                        of him I never know how to stop. I could talk on for an hour in a see saw of praise

                     <p>English Republican military leader, politician, and dictator. The effective protagonist
                        of Mitfordâ€™s playCharles the First. A descendant of the Tudor politician Thomas Cromwell,
                        raised in the Cambridgeshire Fens and educated at Cambridge University, he became
                        deeply spiritual in the 1620s, identifying as a Puritan. (He never called himself
                        a Roundhead, and resisted others' use of this Royalist slur.) He became an M.P. and,
                        in 1641, attacked what he considered ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation. During
                        the Civil Wars, he commanded Parliamentary forces as Lieutenant-General, second only
                        to Sir Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who served as the Parliamentary army's General. Cromwell
                        quickly overshadowed Fairfax and devised the New Model Army (founded 1645). After
                        the king's capture and extradition from the Isle of Wight, Cromwell seemed not committed
                        to the notion of trying and executing the king until the eleventh hour, but ultimately
                        served as a Commissioner at the trial and signed the warrant. In the aftermath of
                        the King's execution, Ireland (which had rebelled in 1641) developed a Royalist resistance,
                        which Cromwell and his son-in-law Henry Ireton suppressed between 1649 and 1651. This
                        war resulted in genocide which killed (through violence, displacement, or disease)
                        up to one third of the Irish population; the exact number of casualties and the time-extent
                        of the period are still debated by historians. The period came to be called An Mallact
                        Cromail (The Curse of Cromwell). In Commonwealth England, Cromwell chaired the Republic's
                        Council of State, then, 1653 until his death in 1658, served as Lord Protector, essentially
                        converting the Republic to a dictatorship and alienating many former supporters. After
                        Cromwell's death and the abdication of the second Lord Protector, his son Richard
                        Cromwell, the Republican experiment ended with Parliament inviting Charles I's son
                        to return from exile to be restored as king. Throughout the nineteenth century, Cromwell's
                        reputation was on an upswing. The trend was towards viewing him as a man guided by
                        devout faith in God, a desire to provide for his country, and a desire to purify the
                        Protestantism in his country.</p>
