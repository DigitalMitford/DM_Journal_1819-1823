                        <span class="placeName">Berkshire</span>. Mentioned in the <span class="title">1811 Poems</span> as well as in <span class="title">Our Village</span> Mitford likely refers to wild
                        forms of the Viola, a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae.
                        It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500 species. Most
                        species are found in the temperate <span class="placeName">Northern Hemisphere</span>.
                        The term pansy is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered
                        cultivars which are used as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are
                        used for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the species. </p>

                        England and Scotland. After the so-called tulip mania in Europe in the 17th century, tulips became associated with the Netherlands and
                        Dutch Golden Age painters, who included them in their still-life paintings. In her

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did

In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>.

                           to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a

                              Jones</span>. He married <span class="persName">Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair</span> in <span class="date">1805</span> at <span class="placeName">Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton,
                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,

                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>

                     <p>Lady Madelina Gordon was born on June 10, 1772,
                        the daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, and Jane Maxwell, at
                        Gordon Castle, Bellie, Moray, Scotland. Her first husband was Robert Sinclair,
                        7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and had one child, John Gordon
                        Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>. They married in 1805 at
                        Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House,
                        Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her
                        siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential
                        aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became
                        Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of
                        Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister
                        <span class="persName">Susan Gordon</span> became Duchess of Manchester through her
                        marriage to <span class="persName">William Montagu, Duke of Manchester</span>. Her
                        sister <span class="persName">Louise Gordon</span> became Marchioness Cornwallis through
                        marriage to <span class="persName">Charles Cornwallis, Marquess of Cornwallis</span>.
                        Her sister <span class="persName">Georgiana Gordon</span> became Duchess of Bedford
                        through marriage to <span class="persName">John Russell, Duke of Bedford</span>. Her
                        brothers were <span class="persName">George Duncan Gordon</span>, who became 5th Duke of
                        Gordon, and <span class="persName">Lord Alexander Gordon</span>. <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>â€™s marriage to Lady Madelina
                        thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland House. Lady Madelinaâ€™s name is
                        variously spelled Madelina and Madalina, although Madelina
                        appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an
                        anglicization of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in

                        <p>English Republican military leader, politician, and dictator. The effective protagonist
                           of Mitfordâ€™s play<span class="title">Charles the First</span>. A descendant of the Tudor politician Thomas Cromwell, raised in the Cambridgeshire
                           Fens and educated at Cambridge University, he became deeply spiritual in the 1620s,
                           identifying as a Puritan. (He never called himself a Roundhead, and resisted others'
                           use of this Royalist slur.) He became an M.P. and, in 1641, attacked what he considered
                           ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation. During the Civil Wars, he commanded Parliamentary forces as Lieutenant-General, second only to Sir Thomas,
                           Lord Fairfax, who served as the Parliamentary army's General. Cromwell quickly overshadowed
                           Fairfax and devised the New Model Army (founded 1645).</p>
                        
                        <p>After the <span class="persName">king</span>'s capture and extradition from the Isle of Wight, Cromwell seemed not committed to
                           the notion of trying and executing the king until the eleventh hour, but ultimately
                           served as a Commissioner at the trial and signed the warrant. In the aftermath of
                           the King's execution, Ireland (which had rebelled in 1641) developed a Royalist resistance,
                           which Cromwell and his son-in-law <span class="persName">Henry Ireton</span> suppressed between 1649 and 1651. This war resulted in genocide which killed (through
                           violence, displacement, or disease) up to one third of the Irish population; the exact
                           number of casualties and the time-extent of the period are still debated by historians.
                           The period came to be called An Mallact Cromail (The Curse of Cromwell). In Commonwealth
                           England, Cromwell chaired the Republic's Council of State, then, 1653 until his death
                           in 1658, served as Lord Protector, essentially converting the Republic to a dictatorship
                           and alienating many former supporters. After Cromwell's death and the abdication of
                           the second Lord Protector, his son Richard Cromwell, the Republican experiment ended
                           with Parliament inviting <span class="persName">Charles I's son</span> to return from exile to be restored as king. Throughout the nineteenth century, Cromwell's
                           reputation was on an upswing. The trend was towards viewing him as a man guided by
                           devout faith in God, a desire to provide for his country, and a desire to purify the
                           Protestantism in his country.</p>
