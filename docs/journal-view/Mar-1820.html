                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture,
                        the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames
                        of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally less wary of humans than their counterparts
                        in continental Europe. Mitford calls the tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                        flowers, blooms in spring in <span class="placeName">Berkshire</span>.
                        Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                        family Primulaceae, native to <span class="placeName">western and southern
                           Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                        species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                        closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                        the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                        Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                        parts of Europe and Asia. </p>

                        forms of the Viola, a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae.
                        It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500 species. Most
                        species are found in the temperate <span class="placeName">Northern Hemisphere</span>.
                        The term pansy is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered
                        cultivars which are used as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are
                        used for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the species. </p>

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that
                           he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,

                           who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                           major effort to collect and edit Mitfordâ€™s letters into a series of volumes,
                           which was completed by his assistant, <span class="persName">Alfred Guy
                              Kingan Lâ€™Estrange</span> a year after Harnessâ€™s death, and published
                           as <span class="title">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                              in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</span>. This collection
                           was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                           publishers, to Harnessâ€™s distress.</p>
                        
                        <p>Harness and <span class="persName">Byron</span> were also friends from
                           their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harnessâ€™s experience of
                           a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                           dedicating the first two cantos of <span class="title">Childe Haroldâ€™s
                              Pilgrimage</span>
                            to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harnessâ€™s reputation as
                           he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                           Mitfordâ€™s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                           the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                           prose. When <span class="persName">William Macready</span> was
                           attacked in an anonymous Blackwoodâ€™s Magazine piece
                           in 1825 for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                           <span class="title">Rienzi</span>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                           the author of the anonymous piece, though in <span class="date">1839</span>
                           after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                           not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                           friend had endured.</p>
                        
                        <p>William Harness was the son of John
                           Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                           April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                           Christâ€™s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                           (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                           Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anneâ€™s in Soho. He was Boyle
                           lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                           1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                           biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                           for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                           and reviews, some for the <span class="title">Quarterly Review</span>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                           minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                           build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                           Margaretâ€™s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate
                           of
                           that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                           Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <span class="persName">Mary Harness</span>
                           and his first cousin <span class="persName">Jemima Harness</span>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                           while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                           Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                           Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.</p>Sources:

                        According to Mitford, Catherine Dickinson was fond of match-making among her friends

                        <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of
                           <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy
                              Jones</span>. He married <span class="persName">Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair</span> in <span class="date">1805</span> at <span class="placeName">Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton,
                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,
                              Berkshire</span> and at <span class="placeName">East Court, Finchampstead,
                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>
