                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture,
                        the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames
                        of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally less wary of humans than their counterparts
                        in continental Europe. Mitford calls the tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>
