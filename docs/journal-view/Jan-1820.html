                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British
                        folk tales and popular culture, the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday
                        in the mid-nineteenth century. The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin
                        or Robert, which led to nicknames of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally
                        less wary of humans than their counterparts in continental Europe. Mitford calls the
                        tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>
