The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                           Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                           Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard

                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                           1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over

                           used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s students
                           performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                           triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions

                        <p>Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                           in <span class="placeName">Plymouth, Devon</span>, from its
                           founding in <span class="date">1782</span>. He was elected a member of
                           Parliament for Plymouth as a
                           supporter of the government and Tory <span class="persName">William

                           in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                           from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                           Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                           son <span class="persName">Jonathan</span> came of age, he tried to
                           secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                           Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                           Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                           the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                           Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. <span class="persName">Sir

                           exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                           to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                           talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                           Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an

                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,

                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>
