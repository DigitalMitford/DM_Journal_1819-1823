                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                        stems allow it to climb over other shrubs and trees, and it carries single pink or
                        white flowers that develop an orange-red hip. The hips may be used to make tea, jelly,
                        pies, syrup, and cordial. This rose is traditionally used in European heraldry.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/plants/wild-flowers/dog-rose/"></iframe><ul>

                        thimbleweed, and smell fox, an allusion to the musky smell of the leaves.
                        However, she may also refer to one of the cultivated varieties not native to
                        England, such as the poppy anemone (Anemone coronaria), which is native to the
                        Mediterranean region but was cultivated elsewhere in Europe beginning in the eighteenth
                        century. Unlike the wood anemone, the poppy anemone appears in bright shades of

                     <p>Friend of the Mitford family. He was the son of Vikris Dickinson and Elizabeth Marchant.
                        The Dickinson family were Quakers who lived in the vicinity of Bristol, Gloucestershire.
                        On <span class="date">August 3, 1807</span>, he married <span class="persName">Catherine Allingham</span> at St Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex. They lived at Farley Hill, near Swallowfield,
                        Berkshire, where their daughter Frances was born, and where the Mitfords visited them.
                        Charles Dickinson owned a private press he employed to print literary works by his
                        friends (See letters to Elford from March 13, 1819 and June 21, 1820). He wrote and
                        published an epic poem in sixty-six cantos, <span class="title">The Travels of Cyllenius</span>, in 1795. Upon his uncle's death, Charles Dickinson inherited the considerable wealth
                        his extended family had amassed in the West Indies.</p>

                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,

                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>
