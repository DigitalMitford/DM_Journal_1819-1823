                     <p>Mary Russell was the youngest child of the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and his second
                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                     <p>Close friend, literary mentor, and frequent correspondent of Mary Russell Mitford.
                        A native of Reading, Talfourd was educated at the Readingâ€™s newly-established Mill
                        Hill school, a dissenting academy, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. Richard Valpyâ€™s
                        Reading School from 1810 to 1812. His career in law began with a legal apprenticeship
                        with Joseph Christy, special pleader, in 1817. He was called to the bar in London
                        in 1821 and ultimately earned a D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June
                        20, 1844. While establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked
                        as legal correspondent for The Times, reporting on the Oxford Circuit, and also continued
                        his literary interests. After 1833, he was appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a
                        Kingâ€™s and Queenâ€™s Counsel. He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for
                        Reading from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849 ; he served with Charles Fyshe Palmer,
                        Charles Russell, and Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and legal career
                        included introducing the first copyright bill into Parliament in 1837 (for which action
                        Charles Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers to him) and defending Edward Moxonâ€™s publication
                        of Percy Shelleyâ€™s Queen Mab in 1841 . He was appointed Queenâ€™s Serjeant in 1846 and
                        Judge of Common Pleas in 1849 , at which post he served until his death in 1854. He
                        was knighted in 1850 . Talfourdâ€™s literary works include his plays Ion (1835), The
                        Athenian Captive (1837) and Glencoe, or the Fate of the MacDonalds(1839).</p>

                     <p>Friend of the Mitford family. He was the son of Vikris Dickinson and Elizabeth Marchant.
                        The Dickinson family were Quakers who lived in the vicinity of Bristol, Gloucestershire.
                        On August 3, 1807, he married Catherine Allingham at St Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex.
                        They lived at Farley Hill, near Swallowfield, Berkshire, where their daughter Frances
                        was born, and where the Mitfords visited them. Charles Dickinson owned a private press
                        he employed to print literary works by his friends (See letters to Elford from March
                        13, 1819 and June 21, 1820). He wrote and published an epic poem in sixty-six cantos,

                     <p>A lifelong friend of Mary Russell Mitford who knew her from their childhood in the
                        1790s, Harness launched the first major effort to collect and edit Mitfordâ€™s letters
                        into a series of volumes, which was completed by his assistant, Alfred Guy Kingan
                        Lâ€™Estrange a year after Harnessâ€™s death, and published as The Life of Mary Russell
                        Mitford, Related in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends. This collection was
                        originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the publishers,
                        to Harnessâ€™s distress. Harness and Byron were also friends from their schooling at
                        Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harnessâ€™s experience of a disabled foot, crushed
                        in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered dedicating the first two cantos
                        of Childe Haroldâ€™s Pilgrimage to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harnessâ€™s
                        reputation as he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitfordâ€™s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of the few
                        of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over prose. When William
                        Macready was attacked in an anonymous Blackwoodâ€™s Magazine piece in 1825 for his demands
                        and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to Rienzi, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in 1839 after many years of distance, Harness
                        assured Macready in person that he was not the writer, though he may have shared word
                        of the poor treatment his friend had endured. William Harness was the son of John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on April
                        13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from Christâ€™s College,
                        Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816).
                        He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit Street, London and minister and lecturer
                        at St. Anneâ€™s in Soho. He was Boyle lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead
                        from 1828 to 1844. In 1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including
                        a biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge for the
                        study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays and reviews, some
                        for the Quarterly Review. From 1844 to 1847 he was minister of Brompton Chapel in
                        London. He undertook to raise the funds to build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge,
                        in the parish of St. Margaretâ€™s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became
                        perpetual curate of that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at
                        3 Hyde Park Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister Mary Harness
                        and his first cousin Jemima Harness, daughter of his uncle William. He died while
                        on a visit to one of his former curates in Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death
                        he living at the same address at 3 Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.Sources:
