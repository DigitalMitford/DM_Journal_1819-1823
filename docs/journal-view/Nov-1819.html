                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                     <p>Small songbird, native to Europe, now considered a type of Old World flycatcher. In
                        Mitford's time, believed to be part of the thrush family, along with nightingales.
                        Not to be confused with the American robin, a new World thrush, this bird is sometimes
                        referred to as an English robin in North America. Frequently referenced in British folk tales and popular culture,
                        the bird became associated with the Christmas holiday in the mid-nineteenth century.
                        The bird's name derives from the male forename Robin or Robert, which led to nicknames
                        of Bob and Bobby. Robins in Great Britain are generally less wary of humans than their counterparts
                        in continental Europe. Mitford calls the tame robins she feeds her bobbies.</p><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/robin/"></iframe><ul>

                        <p>Father of <span class="persName">Mary Rusell Mitford</span>, <span class="persName">George Mitford</span> was the son of <span class="persName">Francis Midford</span>, surgeon, and <span class="persName">Jane Graham</span>. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that
                           he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>, was born two years
                           later on <span class="date">December 16, 1787</span> at <span class="placeName">New

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                        <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of
                           <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy
                              Jones</span>. He married <span class="persName">Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair</span> in <span class="date">1805</span> at <span class="placeName">Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton,
                              Herefordshire</span>
                           . They lived at <span class="placeName">Luckley House, Wokingham,
                              Berkshire</span> and at <span class="placeName">East Court, Finchampstead,
                              Berkshire</span>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                           to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                           Charles Fyshe Palmerâ€™s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to
                           aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                           House.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the
                           member for <span class="placeName">Reading</span>
                           <span class="date">after 1816</span>, and appears to have served off and
                           on in that role until <span class="date">1841</span>. He led the
                           Berkshire meetings to protest British governmentâ€™s handling of the Peterloo Massacre in <span class="date">1819</span>. On <span class="date">March 16, 1820</span>, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against
                           two other candidates. The votes ran: <span class="persName">John
                              Berkeley Monck</span> (418 votes), <span class="persName">Charles Fyshe Palmer</span>(399 votes), and <span class="persName">John Weyland</span>(395 votes.) Mitfordâ€™s
                           letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <span class="persName">J. B. Monck</span>, and she had earlier satirized
                           Palmer in <span class="date">1818</span> as vastly
                           like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long
                           fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance.
                           </p>
                        
                        <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding
                           the Billiard Club, in  her letter to <span class="persName">Talfourd</span> of <span class="date">31 August 1822</span>
                           . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmerâ€™s political opponents
                           sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble
                           privileges (and money) he accrued by marrying <span class="persName">the Lady Madelina Gordon</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>.</p>
