                        of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Unlike other conifers,
                        firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like candles; at maturity,
                        the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                        likely refers to wild forms of the Viola, a genus of flowering plants in the violet
                        family Violaceae. It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500
                        species. Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The term pansy
                        is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered cultivars which are used
                        as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are used for small-flowered annuals
                        or perennials, including the species.</p>

                     <p>One of Mitfordâ€™s favorite flowers, blooms in spring in Berkshire. Mitford likely refers
                        to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, native
                        to western and southern Europe, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+ species
                        of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not closely related
                        to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions the evening primrose
                        in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in Europe since the early seventeenth
                        century and are now naturalized in some parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

                        in mixed woodlands and bears a white flower. It is not related to sorrel proper (Rumex
                        acetosa), although the two plants share an acidic taste that may have led to the name.</p>

                        plant, native to Europe. Common names include wood anemone, windflower, thimbleweed,
                        and smell fox, an allusion to the musky smell of the leaves. However, she may also
                        refer to one of the cultivated varieties not native to England, such as the poppy
                        anemone (Anemone coronaria), which is native to the Mediterranean region but was cultivated
                        elsewhere in Europe beginning in the eighteenth century. Unlike the wood anemone,
                        the poppy anemone appears in bright shades of red and blue.</p><iframe src="https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Anemone"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>According to Lâ€™Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of Mitfordâ€™s father, and Mitford
                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                        for Exeter and for Barnstaple. In a letter to Haydon dated 9 February 1824 , Mitford
                        refers to Northmore as a great Devonshire reformer, one of the bad epic poets and
                        very pleasant men in which that country abounds ( Life of Mary Russell Mitford ed.
                        L'Estrange Vol II, page 22). In an 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford gives this description
                        of Northmore, and mentions his authorship of an epic poem on George Washington: what
                        a man! How loud &amp; shrewd &amp; full of himself &amp; sharp all over from his eagle nose to
                        his pointed hook toe! What a perpetual sky rocket bouncing starting &amp; flaming! What
                        a talker against time! Well might Mr. Hobhouse call him the gentleman who came all
                        the way from Devonshire to tell us that he was a great man at home. And he is a Poet
                        too. Has written an Epic, which must have appeared incognitoâ€“for I never remember
                        to have heard it mentioned in my life. An Epic Poem about Washington . Mitford may

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        and epic poem Gerusalemme Liberata (1574). Tassoâ€™s life and work continued to be the
                        subject of much attention during Mitfordâ€™s lifetime. Byronâ€™s poem The Lament of Tasso,
                        written in Florence, appeared in 1817 ; a translation of Gerusalemme Liberata in Spenserian
                        stanzas by Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen appeared in 1821 ; Donizetti wrote an opera on the
                        subject of Tasso in 1833 , incorporating some of the poetâ€™s work into the libretto;
                        and Franz Liszt composed a symphonic poem, Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo in commemoration
                        of the centenary of Goetheâ€™s birth in 1849 .</p>

                     <p>Mary Russell was the youngest child of the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and his second
                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>
