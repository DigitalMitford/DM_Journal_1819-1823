                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</p>

                        forms of the Viola, a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae.
                        It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500 species. Most
                        species are found in the temperate <span class="placeName">Northern Hemisphere</span>.
                        The term pansy is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered
                        cultivars which are used as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are
                        used for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the species. </p>

                     <p>One of <span class="persName">Mitford</span>â€™s favorite
                        flowers, blooms in spring in <span class="placeName">Berkshire</span>.
                        Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                        family Primulaceae, native to <span class="placeName">western and southern
                           Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                        species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                        closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                        the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                        Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                        parts of Europe and Asia. </p>

                        in mixed woodlands and bears a white flower. It is not
                        related to sorrel proper (Rumex acetosa), although the
                        two plants share an acidic taste that may have led to the name.</p>

                     <p> Mitford may refer to the wood anemone (Anemone
                        nemorosa), an early-spring flowering plant, native to Europe. Common names include
                        wood anemone, windflower,
                        thimbleweed, and smell fox, an allusion to the musky smell of the leaves.
                        However, she may also refer to one of the cultivated varieties not native to
                        England, such as the poppy anemone (Anemone coronaria), which is native to the
                        Mediterranean region but was cultivated elsewhere in Europe beginning in the eighteenth
                        century. Unlike the wood anemone, the poppy anemone appears in bright shades of
                        red and blue.</p><iframe src="https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Anemone"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>Friend of the Mitford family. He was the son of Vikris Dickinson and Elizabeth Marchant.
                        The Dickinson family were Quakers who lived in the vicinity of Bristol, Gloucestershire.
                        On <span class="date">August 3, 1807</span>, he married <span class="persName">Catherine Allingham</span> at St Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex. They lived at Farley Hill, near Swallowfield,
                        Berkshire, where their daughter Frances was born, and where the Mitfords visited them.
                        Charles Dickinson owned a private press he employed to print literary works by his
                        friends (See letters to Elford from March 13, 1819 and June 21, 1820). He wrote and
                        published an epic poem in sixty-six cantos, <span class="title">The Travels of Cyllenius</span>, in 1795. Upon his uncle's death, Charles Dickinson inherited the considerable wealth
                        his extended family had amassed in the West Indies.</p>

                        , Mitford refers to Northmore as a great <span class="placeName">Devonshire</span> reformer, one of the bad epic poets and very pleasant men in which that country abounds (
                        <span class="title">Life of Mary Russell Mitford</span> ed. L'Estrange Vol II, page 22). In an 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford gives this description of Northmore, and mentions
                        his authorship of an epic poem on George Washington: what a man! How loud &amp; shrewd &amp; full of himself &amp; sharp all over from his eagle nose
                        to his pointed hook toe! What a perpetual sky rocket bouncing starting &amp; flaming!

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that

On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as <span class="placeName">Old Alresford</span>; they later came to live
                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>, was born two years
                           later on <span class="date">December 16, 1787</span> at <span class="placeName">New

                           owners and publishers. He was active in Whig politics and later served as a local

                        distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
