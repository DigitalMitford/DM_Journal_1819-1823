                        primrose), a plant bearing yellow flowers in spring, found in woods and meadows, native
                        throughout most of temperate Eurasia, although absent from more northerly areas. May
                        hybridize with English or common primroses.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/plants/wild-flowers/cowslip/"></iframe><ul>

                     <p>One of Mitford’s favorite flowers, blooms in spring in Berkshire. Mitford likely refers
                        to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, native
                        to western and southern Europe, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+ species
                        of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not closely related
                        to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions the evening primrose
                        in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in Europe since the early seventeenth
                        century and are now naturalized in some parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

                     <p>Bulbous flowering perennial plant, native to Atlantic western Europe and the UK, and
                        also frequently used as a garden plant. Carries fragrant violet-blue tubular flowers
                        on a one-sided stem. In Britain, it is found in ancient woodlands, where it forms
                        carpets of flowers in the spring, called bluebell woods. Mitford uses the terms wild
                        hyacinth as well as bluebell for this plant. She uses the term harebell to refer to
                        the more papery bell-flowered campanulas. In a letter to Mrs. Hoare, Mitford explains
                        the different terms: The Wild Hyacinth, my dear Mrs. Hoare, differs much from the
                        flower which we call the harebell in England: a small campanula, bearing two or three
                        exquisite, thin, bell-like papery flowers (you can hear them rustle when shaken) on
                        a very thin and fragile stalk, growing among wild thyme, and under heather, in the
                        month of August. There is a white variety cultivated in gardens, but no pink one.
                        I have heard both the harebell and the wild hyacinth called blue-bells.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/things-to-do/woods-through-the-seasons/spring/best-bluebell-woods/"></iframe><ul>

                     </ul>
                     <p>Mitford likely refers to the common or English oak (Quercus robur), a variety of white
                        oak, although the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is also native to the Europe and the
                        UK. Large, long-lived deciduous hardwood tree with lobed leaves, hanging catkins in
                        spring, and then acorns, oval nuts with woody caps. In 19th-century English forests,
                        oak was the predominant deciduous tree, often found with ash and elm. A hard wood
                        with a distinctive light-and-dark grain, used since the early medieval period for
                        making sturdy furniture, flooring, doors, household items such as chests and buckets,
                        and for building sailing ships, particularly large naval vessels. Because the tree
                        is large, strong and long-lived, it has accumulated numerous symbolic and national
                        associations, particularly in the UK. In English folklore, Robin Hood hid in an oak
                        to escape pursuers, and the oak became a national symbol after the future Charles
                        II reportedly hid in an oak during the English Civil Wars. This tree became known
                        as the Royal Oak, and led to a national celebration of Oak Apple Day in May. Royal
                        Oak became a popular pub name, as well as the name of several Royal Navy warships.
                        The symbolic association between Britain's military strength and the strength of its
                        men is encapsulated in the song Heart of Oak, written in 1759 and revised in 1809:
                        Heart of oak are our ships,/Hearts of oak are our men. Oak leaves, like laurel, were
                        used as ceremonial wreaths and crowns, and both oak leaves and acorns appeared as
                        neoclassical ornaments. The proverb great oaks from little acorns grow, dates from
                        at least the 16th century, and the concept appears in Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/english-oak/"></iframe><ul>

                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her family’s entire estate upon her mother’s death in 1785. Her father’s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Year’s day as the date of her death.</p>

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                     <p>According to L’Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of Mitford’s father, and Mitford
                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                     </ul>
                     <p>Charles Fyshe Palmer was the son of Charles Fyshe Palmer and Lucy Jones. He married
                        Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire
                        . They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead,
                        Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most
                        influential aristocratic families in the country, and Charles Fyshe Palmer’s marriage
                        to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the Holland
                        House. A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the member
                        for Reading after 1816, and appears to have served off and on in that role until 1841.
                        He led the Berkshire meetings to protest British government’s handling of the Peterloo
                        Massacre in 1819. On March 16, 1820, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against two
                        other candidates. The votes ran: John Berkeley Monck (418 votes), Charles Fyshe Palmer(399
                        votes), and John Weyland(395 votes.) Mitford’s letters around this time indicate she
                        much preferred his opponent J. B. Monck, and she had earlier satirized Palmer in 1818
                        as vastly like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long fishing-rod,
                        or anything that is all length and no substance. Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection
                        with a legal issue surrounding the Billiard Club, in her letter to Talfourd of 31
                        August 1822 . Mitford also mentions the ways that Palmer’s political opponents sometimes
                        undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble privileges (and money)
                        he accrued by marrying the Lady Madelina Gordon in 1805.</p>
