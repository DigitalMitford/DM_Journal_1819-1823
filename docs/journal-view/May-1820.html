                        flowers, blooms in spring in <span class="placeName">Berkshire</span>.
                        Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                        family Primulaceae, native to <span class="placeName">western and southern
                           Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                        species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                        closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                        the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                        Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                        parts of Europe and Asia. </p>

                     <p>
                        Mitford likely refers to Primula veris (also called cowslip, common cowslip, cowslip
                        primrose), a plant bearing yellow flowers in spring, found in woods and meadows, native
                        throughout most of temperate Eurasia, although absent from more northerly areas. May
                        hybridize with English or common primroses.</p><iframe src="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/plants/wild-flowers/cowslip/"></iframe><ul>

                        or bell-shaped flowers, distributed throughout the world and cultivated as garden
                        plants. The quintessential lily in European culture is the white Madonna lily (Lilium
                        candidum), native to the Mediterranean, appearing in art, literature, and religious
                        text beginning in the ancient world. When Mitford uses the simple term lily, she likely refers to the Madonna lily.</p><iframe src="https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Lilium"></iframe><ul>

The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In <span class="date">1784</span>, he is listed in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of <span class="placeName">Alresford</span>. His father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that
                           he served a medical apprenticeship with family members.</p>

                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>, was born two years

                           [III] and Catherine Chevalier. He was a friend and literary mentor to
                           <span class="persName">Mary Russell Mitford</span>. He matriculated at
                           Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                           Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                           Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                           1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over
                           to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                           until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="placeName">Reading Grammar School</span> for boys over
                           the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new
                           buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and
                           Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                           as Shakespeareâ€™s King John and Sheridanâ€™s The Critic. His Elements of
                           Greek Grammar, Elements of Latin Grammar,,Greek
                           Delectus and Latin Delectus, printed and published by

                           used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpyâ€™s students
                           performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                           triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                           for the <span class="title">Reading Mercury</span>. In 1803, his
                           adaptation of Shakespeareâ€™s King John was performed at Covent Garden

                     <p>Catherine Allingham was the daughter of Thomas Allingham. She married Charles Dickinson
                        on <span class="date">August 2, 1807</span> at St. Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex. They lived in Swallowfield, Berkshire, where
                        their daughter Frances was born, and where they were visited by the Mitford family.
                        According to Mitford, Catherine Dickinson was fond of match-making among her friends
                        and acquaintances. (See

                        the most famous Beaumont and Fletcher play is the ribald comedy <span class="title">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span>. Beaumont was also a poet and friend of Ben Jonson. He contributed prefatory verses
