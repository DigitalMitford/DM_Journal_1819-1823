                        Firs (Abies) are a genus of approximately fifty species of evergreen coniferous
                        trees in the family Pinaceae. They are found through much of <span class="placeName">North
                           and Central America</span>, <span class="placeName">Europe</span>,
                        <span class="placeName">Asia</span>, and <span class="placeName">North Africa</span>. Unlike
                        other conifers, firs bear erect cones that are raised above the branches like
                        candles; at maturity, the cones disintegrate to release winged seeds.</section>

                        Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                        family Primulaceae, native to <span class="placeName">western and southern
                           Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                        It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                        species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                        closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                        the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                        Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                        parts of Europe and Asia. </section>

                        the females are drab. Hybridization has bred types in a variety of colors. Pheasants,
                        likely from the Caucasus, were naturalized in Britain by at least 1050 AD, and may
                        have arrived earlier, with the Romans. The ring-necked variety was reintroduced in
                        the 18th century. In the UK, the birds are hunted by traditional driven-shoot methods,
                        employing beaters, and rough-shoot methods; both methods rely on gun dogs to flush
                        and retrieve the birds.</section><iframe src="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/pheasant/"></iframe><ul>

                        It is the largest genus in the family, containing more than 500 species. Most
                        species are found in the temperate <span class="placeName">Northern Hemisphere</span>.
                        The term pansy is normally used for those multi-coloured, large-flowered
                        cultivars which are used as bedding plants. The terms viola and violet are
                        used for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the species. </section>
