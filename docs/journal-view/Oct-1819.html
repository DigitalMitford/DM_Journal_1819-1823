                        <p>Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                           in <span class="placeName">Plymouth, Devon</span>, from its
                           founding in <span class="date">1782</span>. He was elected a member of
                           Parliament for Plymouth as a

                           from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                           Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                           son <span class="persName">Jonathan</span> came of age, he tried to
                           secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of

                           Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                           the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                           Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. <span class="persName">Sir

                        , Mitford refers to Northmore as a great <span class="placeName">Devonshire</span> reformer, one of the bad epic poets and very pleasant men in which that country abounds (
                        <span class="title">Life of Mary Russell Mitford</span> ed. L'Estrange Vol II, page 22). In an 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford gives this description of Northmore, and mentions
                        his authorship of an epic poem on George Washington: what a man! How loud &amp; shrewd &amp; full of himself &amp; sharp all over from his eagle nose

                           Economy</span> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,
