                     <p>According to Lâ€™Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of Mitfordâ€™s father, and Mitford
                        met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death in 1837. Elford
                        worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth,
                        Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth
                        as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806.
                        After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament
                        for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service
                        in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his son
                        Jonathan came of age, he tried to secure a stable government post for him but never
                        succeeded. Mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833,
                        he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer
                        in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant
                        Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William
                        was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal
                        Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes.
                        He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur
                        naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he
                        published his findings on an alternative to yeast. He married his first wife, Mary
                        Davies of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth
                        Hall Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.</p>

                        him of the Hampden Club. A Radical, Northmore ran unsuccessfully as Member of Parliament
                        for Exeter and for Barnstaple. In a letter to Haydon dated 9 February 1824 , Mitford
                        refers to Northmore as a great Devonshire reformer, one of the bad epic poets and
                        very pleasant men in which that country abounds ( Life of Mary Russell Mitford ed.
                        L'Estrange Vol II, page 22). In an 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford gives this description
                        of Northmore, and mentions his authorship of an epic poem on George Washington: what
                        a man! How loud &amp; shrewd &amp; full of himself &amp; sharp all over from his eagle nose to
                        his pointed hook toe! What a perpetual sky rocket bouncing starting &amp; flaming! What
                        a talker against time! Well might Mr. Hobhouse call him the gentleman who came all
                        the way from Devonshire to tell us that he was a great man at home. And he is a Poet
                        too. Has written an Epic, which must have appeared incognitoâ€“for I never remember
                        to have heard it mentioned in my life. An Epic Poem about Washington . Mitford may
                        not have seen the poem, since it was published in Baltimore, MD. Northmore's poem

                        wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her birth date is
                        as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years older than her husband
                        George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a distant relation of the Dukes
                        of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two siblings, Charles William and Frances;
                        both predeceased her and their parents, which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                        her familyâ€™s entire estate upon her motherâ€™s death in 1785. Her fatherâ€™s rectory in
                        Ashe was only a short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted with the
                        young Jane Austen. She married George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New
                        Alresford, Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses
                        as Old Alresford. Their only daughter, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later
                        on December 16, 1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire. Mary Russell died on January 2,
                        1830 at Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield, Berkshire. Her obituary in the
                        1830 New Monthly Magazine gives New Yearâ€™s day as the date of her death.</p>

                     <p>Father of Mary Rusell Mitford, George Mitford was the son of Francis Midford, surgeon,
                        and Jane Graham. The family name is sometimes recorded as Midford. Immediate family
                        called him by nicknames including Drum, Tod, and Dodo. He was a member of a minor
                        branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources
                        would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                        there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer
                        to himself as Dr. Mitford, preferring to style himself Esq.. In 1784, he is listed
                        in a Hampshire directory as surgeon (medicine) of Alresford. His father and grandfather
                        worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he served a medical apprenticeship
                        with family members. He married Mary Russell on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                        Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their addresses as Old Alresford;
                        they later came to live at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live
                        to adulthood, Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years later on December 16, 1787
                        at New Alresford, Hampshire. He assisted Mitford's literary career by representing
                        her interests in London and elsewhere with theater owners and publishers. He was active
                        in Whig politics and later served as a local magistrate. He coursed greyhounds with
                        his friend James Webb.</p>

                        Mitford family. According to Mitford, Catherine Dickinson was fond of match-making
                        among her friends and acquaintances. (See Mitford's February 8th, 1821 letter to Elford

                        He published An Essay on Political Economy in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807.
                        His first wife, Isabella Mackie, swindled him of much of his income and nearly bankrupted
                        him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813. Later that year, 11 November
                        1813, Wakefield married Elizabeth Kilgour. He was eventually very successful and much

                     <p>Close friend, literary mentor, and frequent correspondent of Mary Russell Mitford.
                        A native of Reading, Talfourd was educated at the Readingâ€™s newly-established Mill
                        Hill school, a dissenting academy, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. Richard Valpyâ€™s
                        Reading School from 1810 to 1812. His career in law began with a legal apprenticeship
                        with Joseph Christy, special pleader, in 1817. He was called to the bar in London
                        in 1821 and ultimately earned a D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June
                        20, 1844. While establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked
                        as legal correspondent for The Times, reporting on the Oxford Circuit, and also continued
                        his literary interests. After 1833, he was appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a
                        Kingâ€™s and Queenâ€™s Counsel. He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for
                        Reading from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849 ; he served with Charles Fyshe Palmer,
                        Charles Russell, and Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and legal career
                        included introducing the first copyright bill into Parliament in 1837 (for which action
                        Charles Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers to him) and defending Edward Moxonâ€™s publication
                        of Percy Shelleyâ€™s Queen Mab in 1841 . He was appointed Queenâ€™s Serjeant in 1846 and
                        Judge of Common Pleas in 1849 , at which post he served until his death in 1854. He
                        was knighted in 1850 . Talfourdâ€™s literary works include his plays Ion (1835), The
                        Athenian Captive (1837) and Glencoe, or the Fate of the MacDonalds(1839).</p>

                     <p>Tory Member of Parliament and celebrated collector of books, art, and antiquities.
                        Born at Bill Hill, an estate in Wokingham, Berkshire rented by his father. He owned
                        and extensively renovated the house and grounds of the Whiteknights estate from 1798
                        to 1819, when bankuptcy forced the auctioning of the estate and all its contents.
                        The auction created much excitement amongst book collectors, since his library contained
                        works of early works printed in English by Caxton, Pynson, and deWorde; the catalogs
                        of the auction remain an important record of book history and collecting. In 1819,
                        he had commissioned Thomas and Barbara Hofland to produce the lavish publication A
                        Descriptive Account of the Mansion and Gardens of White-Knights: A Seat of His Grace
                        the Duke of Marlborough. By Mrs. Hofland. Illustrated with twenty-three engravings,
                        from pictures taken on the spot by T.C. Hofland. They were never paid for their work
                        because of the bankruptcy. Mitford discusses the Duke's penuriousness and his treatment
                        of the Hoflands in her letters of 1819.</p>
