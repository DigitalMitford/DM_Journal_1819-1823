# DM_Journal_1819-1823
repository for development work with Mary Russell Mitford's Journal of 1819-1823

One set of images is in the GitHub repo and it's based on a typescript made from the handwritten journal:
<https://github.com/DigitalMitford/DM_Journal_1819-1823/blob/master/MitfordJournalPart4-rs.pdf>

The other set of images is in a different file sharing system (via Microsoft Sharepoint): the image files are too large for GitHub, but they show Mitford's handwritten journal:
